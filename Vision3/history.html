            Pac-Man is an arcade- and videogame, which was released in 1980 by Namco.<br><br>

            <h3>Name:</h3>
            The name Pac-Man comes from the Japanese word "paku paku", so it means "open the mouth and close it".<br> At
            first it was named "Puck Man"
            but when it was released in the USA; they were afraid that the name would be <br>changed to "Fuck Man", so
            now the game was renamed to "Pack-Man".<br><br><br>

            <h3>The character Pac-Man:</h3>
            Pac-Man was designed by Toru Iwatani and he told, that he was inspire by a pizza, which lost a
            piece.<br><br><br>

            <h3>Level 256</h3>
            Although the main idea was, that the game would<br> be endless, the split-screen-level 256 was irresolvable.
            <br>That actually wasn't scheduled, but it happened<br> by the reason of a mistake.<br>
