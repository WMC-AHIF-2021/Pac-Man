			<h2>Game target</h2>
			<p>
				In Pac-Man, the goal is to eat all the dots on the playing field. When you have collected all the dots, 
				you move to the next level. This level differs from the previous one mainly by the increasing speed.
				You can control Pac-Man with the arrow keys or the joystick. At the beginning you have three lives. The four ghosts
				Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde are the antagonists and try to catch you by different strategies. If you are eaten 
				by a ghost, you lose a live.
			</p>
			<h2>Level structure</h2>
			<p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td><img src="Images/pacman-level.png" alt="Levelaufbau" class="level"></td>
						<td>
							All Levels in Pac-Man are structured in the same way. You have to collect points to increase your score. 
							If you eat the big dots the the ghosts will turn blue for a certain period of time. During this time you 
							can eat the ghosts. When this happens the ghosts move back to there "Ghost-House" and start again to catch 
							Pac-Man. Catching ghosts is not the only way to earn extra points. There will appear some fruits on the 
							playing field during the game. On the left and on the right side of the level is a tunnen. If you go out 
							on the left side, you will come back on the right side. The tunnel is there to confuse the opponents.
						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>

			<h2>Ghosts</h2>
			<p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td><img src="Images/Blinky.png" alt="Blinky" class="ghosts"></td>
						<td>
							Blinky the Red Ghost is the leader of the four ghosts. He ist known in Japan as Akabei. Blinky is the 
							ghost that is the easiest to figure out. He ist he most aggressive ghost and his hunting process ist 
							the easiest to follow. His target is always Pacman. He follows the square Pacman is on. During the game 
							the reg ghost gets faster and faster.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr><td><br></td></tr>
					<tr>
						<td><img src="Images/Pinky.png" alt="Pinky" class="ghosts"></td>
						<td>
							Pinky is the only female ghost in the group. She is programmed to find differen way to unexpectely ambush 
							the player. So Blinke chases Pac-Man and Pinky cuts the way off. Pinky is the ghost that is the easiest to 
							control and manipulate.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr><td><br></td></tr>
					<tr>
						<td><img src="Images/Inky.png" alt="Inky" class="ghosts"></td>
						<td>
							The behaviour of the cyan ghost Inky is the most difficut to predict. Sometimes he behaves like Blinky, 
							Pinky or Clyde. This is because Inky's target square is a combination of Pac-Man's positon and Blinky's 
							behaviour.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr><td><br></td></tr>
					<tr>
						<td><img src="Images/Clyde.png" alt="Clyde" class="ghosts"></td>
						<td>
							The orange ghost is Clyde. He moves away from Pac-Man rather than towards him.
