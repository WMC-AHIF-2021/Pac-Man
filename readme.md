# Pac-Man
The website shows the main things of Pac-Man. You can learn something about the history, like where it comes from, the time of developement and the main idea of Pac-Man. If you don't know Pac-Man, we will give you a short overwiev of the most important rules. Last but not least we also have a dynamic part, where you can play our own version of Pac-Man.
